#### Requirements
The required imports are `pytorch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
Since the dataset is publicly available, all that is required is the URL of the csv from Github (provided in the `final_project.py` file)
#### How to Run the Code
Simply run the entire `final_project.py` script, and it will output the print statements and plots that are mentioned in the results.
